                <h1 class="ui centered header">Who is Alexander Bonilla?</h1>
                 <p>
                    Born in the surrounding suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, Alexander Bonilla's interest in computer science began at the 
                    University of Illinois at Chicago where he attained his Bachelor in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
                    The ease of building applications with any computer caught his attention and it has escalated from there. 
                    With his drive to learn more about the technological world, he began building projects for Sprouting 
                    Leaders (a non-profit organization), as an intern for Tecture and for his friends. His curiosity to learn more has driven him to 
                    learn a variety of programming languages, which include: Python, C#, SQL, HTML, Typescript and many more. 
                    In order to continue learning, he is always in search of new technologies and continues to 
                    find methods of including them into his projects.

                <p>
                    Growing up in Maywood, Alexander Bonilla attended high school at Proviso Mathematics and Science Academy.  
                    High school would be the place where he was exposed to the world of programming. In his junior year of high 
                    school, he attended a class which introduced him to the programming language, Java. Although he didn't quite 
                    understand his love for programming at the time, this class implanted the idea that this might be his branch 
                    of work for the future. Aside from his high school studies, Alexander spent his time playing multiple sports 
                    during high school, which include: soccer, taekwondo, wrestling and occasionally basketball with friends. 
                    Athletics was a significant part of his life growing up. He took it as far as becoming the captain of the 
                    Proviso East soccer team and joining a traveling taekwondo team that took part in promoting the sport.

                <p>
                    It wasn't until Alexander Bonilla went to the University of Illinois at Chicago that he understood his love for 
                    programming. Here he would learn to utilize Python and begin his journey to learn more about the technological 
                    world.

            <p>
                As Alexander Bonilla has explored the world of programming, he has accumulated his own projects along 
                the way. As he gains expertise in his field of software development this list of projects will grow along 
                with him. All of the code for his projects will be available on his github, which is available to view 
                through the icon in the sidebar. Use these descriptions as a way to better understand the process of building 
                these projects.
